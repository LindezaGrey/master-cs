# Overview of Programming Assignment

## Application

You should develop a Python script or application and use it to meet these requirements:

* Count the number of records in your chosen dataset to verify it has loaded correctly.
* Correctly perform a non-trivial operation (transformation [log, scaling], reduction [min, max, mean] etc.) on the data.
* Structure your code using functions where appropriate.
* Identify any patterns or trends in the records values.
* Verification of your scripted result using Python software libraries e.g. NumPy and Pandas
* Include error handling, user input, loops and iteration â€“ these are basic requirements.

## Report

Your report should be brief (max 1500 words) and describe the goal of your application, the dataset used, a description and reasoning of the methods and choices for data processing and a critical reflection and evaluation based on your results.
